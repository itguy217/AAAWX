I found there was no weather stations setup with this arduino Nano 33 IoT that was setup for sending sensor data to a MYSQL server and Weather Underground. 
I felt compiled to answer this call.

Weather measuring instruments:
[Argent's Wind / Rain Sensor Assembly, Located at https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=29   ]
[Adufruit's BME280 sensor].
[Arduino Nano 33 IoT, use 5 volts]
