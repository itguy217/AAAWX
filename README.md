I found there was no weather stations setup with this arduino Nano 33 IoT that was setup for sending sensor data to a MYSQL server and Weather Underground. 
I felt compiled to answer this call.

***Requirements: A server that is a hardware server or a Virtual Machine (VM) with LAMP - Linux Apache MySQL PHP. ***

Weather measuring instruments:
[Argent's Wind / Rain Sensor Assembly, Located at https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=29   ]
[Adufruit's BME280 sensor].
[Arduino Nano 33 IoT, use 5 volts]
*** The php and the css files go into your Apache www/html folder***
